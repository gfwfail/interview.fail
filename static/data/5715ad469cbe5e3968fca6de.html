But why these two magic numbers? Why other factors do not work?
Let's study the math behind it.</p>

<p>For convenience, say <strong>n</strong> is sufficiently large and can be broken into any smaller real positive numbers. We now try to calculate which real number generates the largest product.
Assume we break <strong>n</strong> into <strong>(n / x)</strong>  <strong>x</strong>'s, then the product will be <strong>x<sup>n/x</sup></strong>, and we want to maximize it.</p>

<p>Taking its derivative gives us <strong>n * x<sup>n/x-2</sup> * (1 - ln(x))</strong>.
The derivative is positive when <strong>0 &lt; x &lt; e</strong>, and equal to <strong>0</strong> when <strong>x = e</strong>, then becomes negative when <strong>x &gt; e</strong>,
which indicates that the product increases as <strong>x</strong> increases, then reaches its maximum when <strong>x = e</strong>, then starts dropping.</p>

<p>This reveals the fact that if <strong>n</strong> is sufficiently large and we are allowed to break <strong>n</strong> into real numbers,
the best idea is to break it into nearly all <strong>e</strong>'s.
On the other hand, if <strong>n</strong> is sufficiently large and we can only break <strong>n</strong> into integers, we should choose integers that are closer to <strong>e</strong>.
The only potential candidates are <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> since <strong>2 &lt; e &lt; 3</strong>, but we will generally prefer <strong>3</strong> to <strong>2</strong>. Why?</p>

<p>Of course, one can prove it based on the formula above, but there is a more natural way shown as follows.</p>

<p><strong>6 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 3</strong>. But <strong>2 * 2 * 2 &lt; 3 * 3</strong>.
Therefore, if there are three <strong>2</strong>'s in the decomposition, we can replace them by two <strong>3</strong>'s to gain a larger product.</p>

<p>All the analysis above assumes <strong>n</strong> is significantly large. When <strong>n</strong> is small (say <strong>n &lt;= 10</strong>), it may contain flaws.
For instance, when <strong>n = 4</strong>, we have <strong>2 * 2 &gt; 3 * 1</strong>.
To fix it, we keep breaking <strong>n</strong> into <strong>3</strong>'s until <strong>n</strong> gets smaller than <strong>10</strong>, then solve the problem by brute-force.</p>

Then we notice what  would happen if we could break pi up into two more terms lets say one of the terms is 2 we would get the terms  pi-2 and 2 so if 2</em>(pi-2) &gt; pi we would get a bigger product and this happens if pi &gt; 4. since there is one other possible number less then 4 that is not 2  aka 3. Likewise for 3 if we instead breakup the one of the terms into pi-3 and 3 we would get a bigger product if 3*(pi-3) &gt; pi which happens if  pi &gt; 4.5.</p>

<p>Hence we see that all of the terms in the product must be 2's and 3's. So we now just need to write n = a<em>3 + b</em>2 such that P =  (3^a) * (2^b) is maximized. Hence we should favor more 3's then 2's in the product then 2's if possible. </p>

<p>So if n = a*3 then the answer will just be 3^a. </p>

<p>if n = a<em>3 + 2 then the answer will be 2</em>(3^a).</p>

<p>and if n = a<em>3  + 2</em>2  then the answer will be 2 * 2 * 3^a</p>

<p>The above three cover all cases  that n can be written as and the Math.pow() function takes O(log n) time to preform hence that is the running time.</p>

<pre><code>public class Solution {
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        if(n == 2)
            return 1;
        else if(n == 3)
            return 2;
        else if(n%3 == 0)
            return (int)Math.pow(3, n/3);
        else if(n%3 == 1)
            return 2 * 2 * (int) Math.pow(3, (n - 4) / 3);
        else 
            return 2 * (int) Math.pow(3, n/3);
    }

2^3 &lt; 3^2
4^3 &lt; 3^4
5^3 &lt; 3^5
6^3 &lt; 3^6
...

Therefore, intuitively, we want as many 3 as possible 
if a number % 3 == 0, we just break it into 3s -&gt; the product is Math.pow(3, n/3)

As for numbers % 3 == 1, we don't want the 'times * 1' in the end; 
    borrowing a 3 is a natural thought. 
    if we borrow a 3, 3 can be divided into 
         case 1: 1 + 2 -&gt; with the extra 1, we have 2*2 = 4
         case 2: (0) + 3 -&gt; with the extra 1, we have 4
         turns out these two cases have the same results
    so, for numbers % 3 == 1 -&gt; the result would be Math.pow(3, n/3-1)*4

Then we have the numbers % 3 == 2 left
     again, we try to borrow a 3,
         case 1: 1+2 -&gt; with the extra 2, we have 1*5 or 3*2 =&gt; 3*2 is better
         case 2: 0+3 -&gt; with the extra 2, we have 2*3 or 5 =&gt; 2*3 is better
     and we actually just end up with not borrowing at all! 
     so we can just *2 if we have an extra 2 -&gt; the result would be Math.pow(3, n/3)*2

Then, we have a couple corner cases two deal with since so far we only looked at 
numbers  that are larger than 3 -&gt; luckily, we only have 2 and 3 left, 
which are pretty easy to figure out

Thus my final solution is 

public class Solution {
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        if(n &lt;= 3) return n-1; //assuming n &gt;= 2
        return n%3 == 0 ? (int)Math.pow(3, n/3) : n%3 == 1 ? (int)Math.pow(3, n/3-1)*4 : (int)Math.pow(3, n/3)*2;
    }
}
